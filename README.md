# InstrumentalXR
A procedural UI toolkit &amp; spec for creating fully 3d, physics-based, instrument-panel style UI in XR

#Installation instructions:
- Clone the repo
- Add [HandshakeVR](https://github.com/jcorvinus/HandshakeVR) to the project. This will get turned into a submodule, eventually.
- If all of Handshake's dependencies were added correctly, you should be set up and ready to go.

## This project is in pre-alpha and probably won't work for you. That's OK. Be patient.
