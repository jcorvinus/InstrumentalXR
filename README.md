# InstrumentalXR
A procedural UI toolkit &amp; spec for creating fully 3d, physics-based, instrument-panel style UI in XR

# Installation instructions:
Clone this repository. Make sure you do recursive to include the critical submodule [InstrumentalCore](https://github.com/jcorvinus/InstrumentalCore), which now contains all of the important functionality. This was done to make it easier to include in your own projects as a submodule. This main repository now exists primarily as a way for me to work on the framework in a unity project. The current unty version is 2021.3.7f1!

## This project is in pre-alpha and probably won't work for you. That's OK. Be patient.
