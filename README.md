# InstrumentalXR
A procedural UI toolkit &amp; spec for creating fully 3d, physics-based, instrument-panel style UI in XR

#Installation instructions:
Don't. It's not ready yet. Right now I'm in the process of making a new version that doesn't rely on Ultraleap technology.

## This project is in pre-alpha and probably won't work for you. That's OK. Be patient.
